# ForYou - Real-time Emotion Analysis App

## Overview

ForYou is an Android application for real-time emotion analysis during online meetings. It uses MediaProjection to cast the screen to SurfaceView, extracts frames using ImageReader and analyzes emotions using a pre-trained model deployed with TensorFlow Lite. The backend is powered by Node.js and MongoDB.

## Emotion Analysis Model

ForYou employs a publicly available pre-trained model for emotion analysis, accessible [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pramod722445/model300). The attributes extracted are saved in a user's database for post-meeting analysis.
